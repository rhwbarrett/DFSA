# DFSA
This repository holds my implementation of a Deterministic Finite State Automaton.

The project consists of two .jar files, a Bash Script for running them, and a directory of .txt files which represent models of particular regular languages.  The regular languages captured in the models directory include: dollar amounts in dollar notation up to $99.99, dollar amounts in word format up to $99.99, numbers in word format up to 99, and "sheeptalk" as described by Jurafsky and Martin in "Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Commputational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition, Second Edition", pp.27-30.  The models supplied in this project have been provided in order to show how the project works, as well as representing a starting point for you creating your own models.  Later in this file, I describe best practices for doing that.

Configuration:
=================
The project is ready to use; simply download from github, and unzip the downloaded file, and you are ready to go!

How to use:
=================
This project is operated through use of the command-line by way of a Bash Script.  After downloading and unzipping the project, simply type <code>cd DFSA</code> to navigate to the DFSA directory.
